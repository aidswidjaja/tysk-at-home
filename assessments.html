			<h1>Assessment policies</h1>
			<ul>
				<li>Assessments will be <strong>online & open-book</strong> — open-book means you can use any resource, including print (e.g textbook), physical (e.g exercise book) and online (e.g Desmos)</li>
				<li>They are timed and will run for <strong>45 or 60 minutes</strong>, except for the Studies of Religion assessments, which are speaking assessments</li>
				<li>You will be supervised through Microsoft Teams — <strong>cameras and microphones must be on at all times</strong> but you can turn your volume down</li>
				<li><strong>School uniform must be worn during the assessment</strong></li>
				<li>Stay at your assessment station for the entire assessment - don't go anywhere</li>
				<li><strong>No timetabled classes</strong> from 3 September to 14 September</li>
				<li>Disability Provisions take place in their own Microsoft Teams room</li>
				<li>You need to have signed the HSC Honesty in Assessment policy</li>
			</ul>
			<h1>In the assessment</h1>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>5 minutes before starting time:</strong> download assessment task from Canvas Notifications page</li>
					<li>Questions will be on Canvas, but write answers in your writing booklets</li>
					<li>Write the Assessment Code at the top of each writing page</li>
					<li><strong>10 minutes after finishing time:</strong> upload answers to Canvas through Microsoft Lens</li>
				</ul>
			<h1>Studies of Religion</h1>
				<ul>
					<li>The Studies of Religion 1-unit and 2-unit assessments are Viva Voce speaking assessments</li>
					<li>Basically, you have to have a discussion (usually with some questions asked by the examiner) for 4-5 or 7-8 minutes (depending on your course) about the assigned topic</li>
					<li>Unlike other assessment tasks, SOR assessments are individually scheduled - check the notification for your speaking times</li>
					<li>Instead of Microsoft Teams, use the allocated Zoom link for your speaking room (available on the notification)</li>
				</ul>
